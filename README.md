# C# Patterns
Inspired by the wonderful [Refactor Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/csharp) I set out to take their post a step further and implement the patterns in a Game Context. The purpose is two-fold:
* I wish to sharpen my own abilities
* I hope what I make can be used by others as well to learn and further their programming knowledge

I would like for this repository to act as a knowledge base on how to quickly and easily understand these patterns so that they can be used in your own games to better the maintainability of your code.

These patterns exist for a reason, and that's because we know they work.

All of the Code is MIT licensed, so feel free to do whatever you want with it. But hopefully learn from it most of all!
